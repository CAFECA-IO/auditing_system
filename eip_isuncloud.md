## Abstract

This interface is designed to standardize the process of minting, sharing, and managing reports generated by the iSunCloud auditing system. It leverages the unique properties of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) to ensure each report's uniqueness and traceability. This standardization aims to enhance the integrity and verification process of auditing reports in the realm of renewable energy, providing a secure, transparent, and efficient mechanism for handling these critical documents in the blockchain ecosystem

## Specification

The iSunCloud Report NFT Standard defines a set of operations for minting, sharing, and managing NFTs that represent reports generated by the iSunCloud auditing system. Each report NFT MUST contain metadata detailing the report's name, the starting time point of the report, and the ending time point of the report, following the structure defined in the IERC_ISUNCLOUD interface. The minting function SHALL create a new NFT and assign it a unique token ID, ensuring each report is technically distinct. Although the content (metadata) of each report may be the same, when the share() function is used to share a report, the system will copy the report's metadata to the target address, and the newly minted NFT will have a new, incremented token ID, thus maintaining the uniqueness of each NFT. Sharing of report NFTs SHALL be facilitated through a dedicated function, allowing transfer to specified addresses while maintaining traceability. Implementations of this standard MUST be compliant with the ERC-721 protocol to ensure interoperability across different platform. This specification RECOMMENDS implementing additional security measures to prevent unauthorized access and modifications to the report NFTs.

## Rationale

The rationale behind the iSunCloud Report NFT Standard is to leverage the unique capabilities of blockchain technology, specifically NFTs, to enhance the security, authenticity, and traceability of audit reports generated by the iSunCloud system. By encoding these reports as NFTs, each document is given a distinct, immutable identity on the blockchain, ensuring its authenticity and preventing tampering. The ability to share these NFTs securely through a dedicated function addresses the need for controlled yet flexible distribution of sensitive audit information. Adhering to the ERC-721 standard ensures interoperability across various platforms, making the system versatile and accessible. This approach represents a significant advancement in maintaining the integrity and trustworthiness of audit documents in the renewable energy sector.

## Security Considerations

In considering the security aspects of the iSunCloud Report NFT Standard, it's crucial to address potential risks associated with the handling and storage of sensitive audit report data on the blockchain. The immutable nature of NFTs ensures that once a report is minted, its content cannot be altered, which is vital for maintaining the integrity of the audit information. However, this also means that any errors in the report prior to minting become permanent. Furthermore, smart contract vulnerabilities must be rigorously tested and mitigated to prevent exploits that could lead to unauthorized access or manipulation of NFTs. Adequate measures for access control and authentication are essential to ensure that only authorized parties can mint, share, or transfer report NFTs. The implementation should also consider privacy concerns, as blockchain transactions are typically public, which could lead to unintended exposure of sensitive information.
